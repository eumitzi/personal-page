A webpage created using some model found while completing HTML module on SoloLearn learning Platform.

It contains basic HTML elements and it helps me understand the tree structure of an HTML document.

                Hey! I'm <strong>Miha</strong>. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps. Learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. And I learned it all at <strong>SoloLearn</strong> where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated. Join me in this rewarding journey. <i> I also had some moments when I found it impossible and "not for me", but I did not give up.</i> You'll have fun, get help, and learn along the way!
